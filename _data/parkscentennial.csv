to architectural firm Proudfoot and Bird seeking input on the design and cost of a new building. William
T. Proudfoot provided a basic sketch and suggested the building would cost $80,000. In 1911, the
legislature allocated $225,000 for a new library, but movement would be slow in planning the new
building. The library remained in Morrill Hall for two more years.",,zxx; eng,1900s,,,Iowa State College.
